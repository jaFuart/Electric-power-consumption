### Description
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” 

### Dataset
[Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20Mb]

### The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

***P.S.*** In the plots, the designations of the days of the week are set in accordance with the language of the system, so instead of "Thu", "Fri" and "Sat" there are "Чт", "Пт" and "Сб", which means the same thing, but in Russian ;)
